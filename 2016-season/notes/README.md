# Notes from Nendaz Freeride Junior 2016
First competition ever. 

## Face
Dent de Nendaz East Face, the classic!

## Conditions
Good snow, mid-March, top was a little blown but overall safe conditions.

## Juging Notes
Winner threw a backflip off the start lip, from that event onwards, they 
banned upside down tricks in Junior Competitions. Considered throwing a 3 off
the top but didn't feel comfortable on my first comp, played it safe.

## Line Notes
Playful line that not many people chose, huge mistake was not accounting for
the runout after first feature, I landed fast as fuck and turned right hard
but it was too much speed to shed so I couldn't line up the second 
feature as planned. Instead I improvised and snuck between the trees 
but it totally stopped the run as I had no more speed and it was a tight 
squeeze. 

## Skill Notes
Lost my balls on the first feature, should've slowed down a little before 
to scope it out and then sent it hard. Here instead I stopped hard in 
the middle of the feature and waited 2 secs, 
lost a ton of fluidity points there.
