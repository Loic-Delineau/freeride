# Notes from Nendaz Freeride Junior 2016
First competition ever. 

## Face
Dent de Nendaz East Face, the classic!

## Conditions
Good snow, mid-March, top was a little blown but overall safe conditions.

## Juging Notes
Winner threw a backflip off the start lip, from that event onwards, they 
banned upside down tricks in Junior Competitions. Considered throwing a 3 off
the top but didn't feel comfortable on my first comp, played it safe.

## Line Notes
Playful line that not many people chose, huge mistake not accounting for
runout after first feature, couldn't line up second feature as planned
so I snuck between the trees but it totally stopped the run. 

## Skill Notes
Lost my balls on the first feature, should've slowed down a little before and
sent it. Here I stopped hard in the middle of the feature and waited 2 secs,
lost a ton of fluidity points there.
